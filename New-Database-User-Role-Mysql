Create database:
CREATE DATABASE <db_name>;
Create user:
CREATE USER '<user_name>'@'*' IDENTIFIED BY '<user_pass>';
Grant him privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON <db_name> . * TO '<user_name>'@'*';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

This user will be now able to log in to database only from localhost. If you want connect remotely, i suggest use SSH tunel
